# CodeLabellingGUI
Repository of the CodeLabellingGUI application developed for the LINFO1101 Python introductory course at UCLouvain. This application can be used as a graphical interface for the CESReS model.

This work has been initiated as a personal project and is not directly linked to the associated Master's thesis. However, since it can interface with it, we provide the software one could use.

This repository is under construction. We want to finish documentation before providing the source code.
You can already play with the pre-compiled version this repository currently offers.
