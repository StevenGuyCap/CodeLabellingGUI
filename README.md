# CodeLabellingGUI
Repository of the CodeLabellingGUI application developed for the LINFO1101 Python introductory course at UCLouvain. This application can be used as a graphical interface for the CESReS model.

This repository is under construction. We want to finish documentation before providing the source code.
You can already play with the pre-compiled version this repository currently offers.
